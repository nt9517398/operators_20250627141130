view.json file is now divided into 21 sections.
First, here is the main structure of the file. You will need to place the components from Sections 2 through 21 inside the children array of this root structure.
Section 1: Root Structure
{
  "custom": {},
  "params": {},
  "props": {
    "defaultSize": {
      "width": 1021
    }
  },
  "root": {
    "children": [
      {
        "children": [
          // Place the content of Sections 2 through 21 here
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
